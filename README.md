**Project Title: Conversational AI**

**Description:**
The Conversational AI project aims to create an advanced conversational agent using Python, incorporating Natural Language Processing (NLP) and the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) library. This project demonstrates the power of AI in simulating human-like conversations and understanding natural language inputs.

**Features:**
- Natural Language Processing: Utilizes NLP techniques to analyze and interpret user inputs.
- Conversational Agent: Simulates human-like conversations with users.
- Interactive Interface: Provides an interactive platform for users to engage with the conversational AI.

**Installation:**
1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/itsdiwakarprasad/ConversationalAi.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
